#### About these files

The rules in "ro4 xx.txt" and "sym xx.txt" were collected in 2021. They were selected from a lot of randomized rules generated by a much simpler program. Actually, these rules were an important motivation for this project. For many years I couldn't forget how I was shocked by the following rule (you can find it in "ro4 b.txt"):

The new rules (those in "rulexx.txt") were collected during the development of this program. Some comments are outdated/confusing as they were referring to some features in the early versions of this program, which may have been removed/renamed/heavily redesigned.

I'd recommend taking a look at some of these lists. The most direct way is to copy to the clipboard and do "Clipboard/Read clipboard" in the program. (There are going to be refined lists of these rules in the future.)
